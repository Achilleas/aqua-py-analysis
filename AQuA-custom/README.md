----------------------------------

AQuA (**A**strocyte **Qu**antification and **A**nalysis) is a tool to detect events from microscopic time-lapse imaging data of astrocytes. The algorithm is data-driven and based on machine learning principles, so, potentially, it can be applied across model organisms, fluorescent indicators, experimental modes, cell types, and imaging resolutions and speeds.

# Download and installation
## MATLAB GUI

1. Download latest version **[here](https://github.com/yu-lab-vt/AQuA/archive/master.zip)**.
2. Unzip the downloaded file.
3. Start MATLAB.
4. Switch the current folder to AQuA's folder.
5. Double click `aqua_gui.m`, or type `aqua_gui` in MATLAB command line.

We tested on MATLAB versions later than 2017a. Earlier versions are not supported.

## Fiji plugin

1. Download **[here](https://github.com/yu-lab-vt/AQuA-Fiji/releases)**.
2. Put the downloaded `Aqua.jar` to the plugins folder of Fiji.
3. Open Fiji.
4. In the `Plugins` menu, click `Aqua`.
5. Open movie and choose project path in AQuA GUI.

Some browsers may show a warning when downloading the 'jar' file. Please choose 'keep file'.

# Getting started
If you are using AQuA for the first time, please read
**[the step by step user guide](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1vUZP44KG3B4m4LZXfzcauiyp-Sqd0eJ1)**.

Or you can check the **[details on output files, extracted features, and parameter settings](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1U3oJpEFwv0lXdax6efSnoifcYjJuRzj3)**.

# Example datasets
You can try these real data sets in AQuA. These data sets are used in the supplemental of the paper.

**[Ex-vivo GCaMP dataset](https://drive.google.com/open?id=13tNSFQ1BFV__42TY0lZbHd1VYTRfNyfD)**

**[In-vivo GCaMP dataset](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1TjfFzlg_6BxsFX_l3-P92M5Rp_5j6wiM)**

**[GluSnFr dataset](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1XFJBE18sQTa6svXXRV1TidgNPSv-ldtY)**

We also provide some synthetic data sets. These are used in the simulation part of the paper.
